                <p>Furina is not considered an Archon, 
                as she did not carry any of the divinity of Focalors and was fully human. This is further indicated by the conversation between Focalors and Furina shown in The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur, in which Focalors tasks Furina with pretending to be a god without being one or attempting to become one. Despite the urgency and great importance of Furina's task, Focalors did not provide Furina with anything that would help make Furina's false identity</p>

                <br>
            <p>Furina is a fair-skinned girl who uses the medium female model. Her eyes are heterochromatic in shades of blue. She has soft white hair with light blue streaks. Arkhe alignments cause changes in Furina's features.

                Pneuma Furina's hair is sectioned into two parts, similar to a jellyfish cut: a short wavy bob cut of white, and a layer underneath of twin strands. Both sport "glowing" blue streaks. Her outfit is centered around pale blues and white.
                
                Ousia Furina's hair is shortened to only the bob section. A single lock of hair, like a long ahoge, points towards the right of her hat. Her outfit is centered around dark blues and black.</p>
