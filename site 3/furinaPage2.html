                <br><i>
                <p> One lie always follows another, and so "justice" awaits
                    inescapably at the end. The ignorant see this as some kind of farce.
                    But if they trace back to the source, they inevitably realize that they
                    began by deceiving themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>—A disordered fable left in someone's dream by Mage "N"
                    <br>
            </i>
                <br>Undoubtedly, Furina has been much loved by the people of Fontaine from the moment she became the Hydro Archon.
                
                Her charismatic parlance, lively wit, and elegant bearing — all bear witness to her godly charms.
                
                But perhaps the thing that she is most revered for is her unrivaled sense of drama.
                
                As the protagonist of a famous play at the Opera Epiclese once put it,
                
                "Life is like the theater — you never can tell when the twist will come."
                
                Furina is as inscrutable as the most cunning of stage characters, her course of action defying all prediction.
                
                In fact it's precisely for this reason that the god of Justice and Judgment, unapproachable in her divine majesty, has such a bewitching influence.
                
                But when the curtain falls, a hollow feeling invariably starts to creep in.
                
                There are those who wonder whether there are moments in the dead of night when even a god like Furina feels the sharp pangs of loneliness.
                
                No, surely not. People couldn't possibly imagine, let alone believe, that such a scene might play out.
                
                And that's indeed the way it should be.
                
                That is, were it not for the fact that Furina's tears had already been silently washed away by the Fountain of Lucine.</p>
